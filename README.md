Top 10 Interview Questions

1.Tell Me about Yourself (30 to 45 sec)
I've always seen job postings for software engineering but never thought to look into the job.
I had experience building Shopify stores for my own businesses and it was something I enjoyed, and I 
would come across html all the time. After coming across freecodecamp I tried out html and css. I liked it,
but I was suprised that I did. I was used to building websites off using templates. I joined TrueCoders not too
long after and I began to learn C# and JavaScript. It's been an exciting journey and I found a career
that I enjoy doing. I tightened up my expertise with the knowledge I gained from bootcamp and also
studying on my own. I'm self-driven, very determined and a quick learner. 


2. What are your Strengths?
I can pick up  on things easily. I'm always looking into ways to enhance my skills, and to add value to the company.
While I can work independently, I also work well with team members and can contribute immediately. I have many creative
ideas and I believe I would be a great asset, someone who will help this company grow.



3. What are your biggest Weaknesses?
I struggled with applyiing myself to get things done. I used to procrastinate instead of attacking the task right away.
I started to think less about the task at hand and I just apply myself right away so that I can get all of my work done.
Once I get started I noticed that I'm way more productive and active, so that really became a habit. I don't procrastinate
and I have become really efficient and more productive since i takcked that problem.

4. Why do you want to work here?

I believe we can scale the business and draw more people by making it more efficient. I can be very
creative and enthusiasted, especially working in this field for a Real Estate company. I believe in
the continual growth of this business and better productivity, which all can start with the Software
Engineering department.


5. Why did you leave your last job?
My previous job I was an Independent Contractor. I wanted to change careers because I felt like there 
was a more exciting career that I can start. Once I learned more about Software Engineering, I knew

6. What is your Biggest Accomplishment?
One of my biggest accomplishment was went I left my regular job, and decided to start my
own business. It was a difficult decision, but I really felt that it was a good route for
me to go. After my first business venture things didn't go well, but I never gave up. I looked
into starting a travel agency and ended up getting an LLC. It has been a good venture that
help to establish myself independently. It presented challenges that my previous job never
would had. I had to figure things out on my own, I was able to do things independently, and
it helped to enhance my problem-solving capabilities, and I'm great at working independently
or in a team environment.



7. Describe a difficult problem you were faced with and what did you do to overcome it?
I've built a few websites in Shopiify. I would come across problems all the time. Unfortunately,
you don't always get the help you need once you run into a problem there. I was able to figure out
ways to using Microsoft Excel to change prices and to make bulk adjustments with my product prices,
and other problems I ran into when there was problems with the pricing integration or taxes and many
other things.

a hard worker, but I know how to be efficient and can be of great help to a team. I don't there's a
task that is too much for me.  I would like grow and hone my skills with this company.
